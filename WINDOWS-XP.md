## Overview
Windows XP was released by Microsoft in October 2001 and became one of the most widely used operating systems in computing history. Microsoft officially ended support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014, after more than 12 years of updates.

## End of Support Definition
End of support means Microsoft no longer provides:
- Security updates
- Bug fixes
- Technical support
- Hardware or software compatibility updates

This applies to all editions of Windows XP.

## Security Implications
After April 8, 2014:
- Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not patched
- Systems are more vulnerable to malware and cyberattacks
- Many antivirus vendors discontinued XP support

Using Windows XP on the internet presents significant security risks.

## Software and Hardware Compatibility
- Modern applications no longer support Windows XP
- Current web browsers do not function or receive updates
- New hardware drivers are unavailable

These limitations make XP unsuitable for modern use.

## Impact and Legacy
Windows XP remained in use long after support ended, especially in:
- Legacy business systems
- ATMs and industrial machines
- Environments dependent on older software

Its long lifespan reflects its reliability and popularity.

## Microsoft Recommendation
Microsoft recommended upgrading to a newer version of Windows or replacing hardware that could not support modern operating systems.

## Conclusion
Windows XP marked an important era in personal computing. However, continued use after end of support poses serious security and compatibility risks. Today, Windows XP should only be used in offline or legacy environments.
