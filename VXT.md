**README**  
**Release Date:** 11/08/2006

## OVERVIEW

The Virtual X-Base Terminal (VXT) is a software utility designed to simulate
a minimal virtual terminal environment on Windows XP x64 platforms. VXT
provides a controlled interface for testing, diagnostics, and development
purposes.

VXT is intended for evaluation and simulation only and does **not** provide
full operating system capabilities or run native Windows applications.

---

## PURPOSE

The primary goals of VXT are:

- Provide a virtual terminal interface for Windows XP x64  
- Simulate system shell and core operations in a controlled environment  
- Enable testing of service dependencies and minimal system components  
- Support developers and system administrators in evaluation scenarios  

VXT is **not intended for production deployment**.

---

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Minimum system requirements for VXT:

- Windows XP x64 Edition installed  
- 512 MB RAM or higher  
- 1 GHz or faster processor  
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled (if running in simulation mode)  
- Display resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels or higher  
- Keyboard and mouse or compatible pointing device  

No additional installation of Windows components is required.

---

## FEATURES

VXT includes the following simulated capabilities:

- Virtual terminal interface  
- Basic shell navigation and command simulation  
- Core file system and directory operations  
- Support for limited virtual services  
- Logging of user and system actions within the terminal  

**Note:** All applications and system processes are simulated. No actual
Win32, .EXE, or MSI applications are executed.

---

## USAGE

To launch VXT:

1. Copy or extract all files to a local directory  
2. Run `vxt.exe` (or open `index.html` for web-based simulation)  
3. Use the terminal interface to navigate and perform simulated operations  

VXT is intended for controlled evaluation, testing, and learning purposes.

---

## LIMITATIONS

When operating VXT:

- Full Windows XP applications cannot be runned  
- Networking and external device access may be disabled  
- Printing, multimedia, and advanced services are not available  
- Some system features may behave differently than a real Windows XP x64 system  

These limitations are by design and expected.

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- VXT is provided for testing, evaluation, and educational purposes only  
- This configuration is **not recommended for daily use**  
- Users should document any changes to system or simulated configurations  
- Data loss may occur if used outside of controlled environments

## SUPPORT

VXT is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, either expressed
or implied.

No official technical support is available.
